This is designed to fly RC airplanes using motion controls.
This is a project to get motion controls into a radiomaster TX16s radio using a gyro and IMU. This is done over SBUS trainer on the aux port of the tx16s due to apparent unreliability of the 3.5mm port on the tx16s. There is currently using only the internal IMU of the arduino nano 33 iot but can easily be adapted.
In the works:
external IMU with magnetometer
button to reset level
3d printed case
lever potentiometer for throttle
precision improvements
error handling
